# IK1203-Networks-and-Communication

The goals of the course is to teach the basics of networking and communication. For those interested in specializing in networking, it provides the fundamentals on which later courses build.

For those focusing on other areas of IT, it provides the basic knowledge needed to understand how networks and communication can be securely and effectively utilized in systems and applications.

After completing the course, students should be able to

describe and explain the basic terminology used in networking and communication
analyse communication scenarios and application requirements, and explain what methods and algorithms are suitable to use for a desired communication service
explain, model and analyse the behaviour of networks using different methods for error control, flow control and congestion control, and predict how such a system will react in response to different events and conditions
explain the functions of protocols of the different layers of the Internet model, and how different layers interact with each other
explain and implement basic algorithms and mechanisms for error detection, error correction, flow control, congestion control and routing
design, implement and analyse the behaviour of basic Internet applications and their protocols
explain different functions and concepts concerning equipment for communication and networks
compute and/or approximate the performance of communication systems, and suggest improvements.
